Netflix-HomePage Clone

Jan 2025 - Present

A responsive clone of the Netflix homepage built using HTML and CSS, designed to replicate its layout and functionality for an immersive user experience.

Key Features:

1.Responsive Design: Created a mobile-first, fluid layout using Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure seamless adaptation across all screen sizes.

2.Layout Replication: Mimicked Netflix's header, navigation, and content display sections for a familiar user interface.

3.Styling: Utilized modern CSS techniques like media queries to ensure responsiveness and consistency.

4.Visual Design: Focused on accurate color schemes, font styles, and button placements to match the Netflix brand.

Technologies:

*HTML/CSS: Structure, styling, and layout.

*Flexbox & CSS Grid: For responsive design and layout alignment.

*Media Queries: To ensure a fully responsive experience across devices.

Possible Add-Ons:

Backend Integration: Adding a backend to fetch real-time movie/show data, handle user profiles, favorites, and provide authentication (sign-up, login). This would enable dynamic content updates and allow users to save preferences, creating a personalized experience similar to Netflix.
This project enhanced my front-end development skills and would be further expanded with backend features to create a more dynamic and interactive web app.![Screenshot 2025-02-05 012955](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7656aced-50fc-45d8-a66f-29e2ba22d0f5)
